**asyncio.TaskGroup** is a high-level API introduced in Python 3.11 to manage and run multiple asynchronous tasks concurrently. It provides a way to group tasks together and ensures that all tasks are properly awaited, even if some of them fail.

**asyncio.Future** is a fundamental part of the asyncio module, providing a way to manage and work with the results of asynchronous operations. It acts as a placeholder for a value that will be available at some point in the future.
